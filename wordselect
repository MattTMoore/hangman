## this requires a file I got from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words.txt
w=open("bigwords.txt","a")
r=open("words.txt","r")

for words in r:
    if len(words)>4:
        w.write(str(words))
        
w.close
## this filters out all words with 5 or more letters as any less wouldnt make a good game of hangman.
